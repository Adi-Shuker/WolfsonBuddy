The architecture of the app is based on the *MVC* architectural pattern. <br>
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller.<br>
Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application.<br>
MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-standard web development framework to create scalable and extensible projects.
